We're given an integer 'N' by the user. Our task is to calculate the factorial of this number and print it. The factorial of a number is the product of all positive integers up to that number.

For example, the factorial of 5 (denoted as 5!) is 1 * 2 * 3 * 4 * 5 = 120.
package com;
import java.util.*;
public class Factorial {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner scan=new Scanner(System.in);
		System.out.println("Enter number to find factorial");
		int n=scan.nextInt();
		int fact=1;
		for( int i=1;i<=n;i++)
		{
			fact=fact*i;
		}
		System.out.println("Factorial of "+n+" is "+fact);
			
		}
		
	}
