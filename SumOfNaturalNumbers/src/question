Print the sum of N natural numbers where N is an integer input by the user.

Problem: We are given a positive integer N by the user. Our task is to calculate the sum of the first N natural numbers and print it out. Natural numbers are simply numbers that you naturally count, i.e., 1, 2, 3, and so on.

For example, if N is 5, we want to calculate the sum 1+2+3+4+5, which equals 15.
package com;
import java.util.*;
public class Naturalnumber {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner scan=new Scanner(System.in);
		System.out.println("Enter N");
		int n=scan.nextInt();
		int sum=0;
		for( int i=1;i<=n;i++)
		{
			sum=sum+i;
		}
		System.out.println("sum is"+sum);
			
		}
			
		
		
		
		
	
	 {
		
	}
